Description: A Collection of statistical tests for the detection of differential
    item functioning (DIF) in multistage tests. Methods entail logistic regression,
    an adaptation of the simultaneous item bias test (SIBTEST), and various score-based tests.
    The presented tests provide itemwise checks that item response curves remain stable with 
    regard to categorical, ordinal or metric covariates. Methods for uniform and non-uniform 
    DIF effects are available.
